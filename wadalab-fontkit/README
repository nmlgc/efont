What is this?

	This directory contains CLWFK (Common Lisp port of Wadalab Font Kit).
	Currently only the glyph generator is ported (skeleton editor not yet).
	Original version of Wadalab Font Kit are available from
	http://gps.tanaka.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wadalabfont/

	This port is developed for a totally free font (it will be called as
	`Sazanami' font family).

Tested compilers:

	CMU Common Lisp Snapshot-2004-05 (FreeBSD/x86)
	(CMUCL 18e's compiler is not supported due to loss of precision)

	GNU GNU CLISP 2.33 (compiled binary is not supported yet.)
	(CLISP 2.30 is not supported - it causes stack overflow)

How to build glyphs:

	Install CMUCL and Type `make' in this directory.
	Output font files are embedded in build/outline/wadalab-*/*.ps.
	You can extract them by wftopfa (ftp://ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/
	Font/tools/wftopfa.c).

	If you want to build 'Sazanami' fonts, you must install FontForge
	(http://fontforge.sf.net). You can build TTFs by typing `make'
	at ../sazanami/ directory.

Differences from original

	This port is based on wadalab font kit 20030826 and a renderer patch
	(http://khdd.net/kanou/fonts/wadalab/patch.skeleton-editor.tar.gz)
	is applied to it.

	Added files: renderer/compat.l, renderer/compile.l, renderer/out2sfd.l.
	Removed file: primdata/prim-pack.l (a binary file).
	Renamed file: All substrings in files and their names 'naal' are 
		      substitute to 'maru', a name of generic category.

	Currently glyph editor and experimental codes are not ported.
